# COMP-1549-M01-2023-24-Advanced-Programming
This is the coursework for advanced algorithms

from my knowledge this is what we have to do ~ Ansad
In this coursework, we have to create a program that assigns people(users), and ID, port and ip address. it also ask us to create a login for each user in the server.
The program will assign the Coordinator(think coordinator as the admin of the system) the first person to log to the system. Any new user who logs on to the system should be informed the details of the current coordinator.

The coordinators role should get periodic updates of active members, or member who are active.Any member can request details of existing members from
the coordinator and will receive everyone's IDs, IP addresses and ports including the current group
coordinator.

Based on the details, everyone should be able to send private or broadcast messages
to every other member through the server. 

Anyone can leave the group at any time, however, if the
coordinator leaves, then any existing member will become a coordinator. In case any member
leaves, the communication among the remaining group members should not be interrupted. The
system should print out messages sent to/by the members

Think of this coursework like creating a GC with an Admin.
